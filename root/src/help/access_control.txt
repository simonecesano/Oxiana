User access rights are are managed at the book or map level  and are checked

- at the item level
- at the query level

At the item level they are checked via two methods, is_readable_by and is_writeable_by. These check that the item can
be read/written by the user. In case of a book/map, they are checked directly, while at the lower levels in the object
hierarchy (pois, chapters, book items) they are checked by looking up user rights of the map or book they belong to. 

At the query level two pre-set queries writeable_by and readable_by return only items that are readable or writeable by
the user specified as the first parameter.

What happens with books? How do they handle mixed content, which comes both from public maps and from private ones?
Where do they get the rights from? Probably from the most restrictive policy, or they are private by default.
